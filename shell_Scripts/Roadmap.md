1. Foundations (Must-Have Basics)

Before tools, you need strong fundamentals.

1.1 Operating Systems (Linux)

DevOps runs on Linux.

Learn:

Linux filesystem, permissions, users/groups

Basic commands (ls, cd, grep, awk, sed, tar, curl)

Process management (ps, top, kill)

System services (systemctl)

Logs (/var/log)

🎯 Goal: Be comfortable managing a Linux server from terminal

1.2 Networking Basics

You must understand how systems talk.

Learn:

TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS

DNS, Load Balancers

Ports, firewalls

SSH

CIDR, subnets (basic level)

🎯 Goal: Debug connectivity issues confidently

1.3 Git & Version Control

DevOps = automation + collaboration.

Learn:

Git basics (clone, commit, push, pull)

Branching & merging

Pull requests

GitHub/GitLab workflows

🎯 Goal: Manage code changes in a team environment

2. Programming & Scripting

You don’t need to be a full developer, but automation is everything.

2.1 Scripting

Learn one scripting language well:

Bash (mandatory)

Python (highly recommended)

Learn:

Variables, loops, conditions

Writing automation scripts

Calling APIs

Parsing JSON/YAML

🎯 Goal: Automate repetitive tasks

3. CI/CD (Core of DevOps)

This is where DevOps really begins.

3.1 CI/CD Concepts

Learn:

Continuous Integration

Continuous Deployment / Delivery

Build → Test → Deploy pipelines

3.2 CI/CD Tools

Learn at least one deeply:

GitHub Actions

GitLab CI

Jenkins

Learn:

Pipeline syntax

Artifacts

Environment variables

Secrets management

🎯 Goal: Build a pipeline that deploys code automatically

4. Containers & Containerization

Modern DevOps revolves around containers.

4.1 Docker

Learn:

Images & containers

Dockerfile

Volumes & networks

Docker Compose

🎯 Goal: Package an app and run it anywhere

5. Kubernetes (Advanced Core Skill)

Kubernetes is non-negotiable for DevOps roles.

Learn:

Pods, Services, Deployments

ConfigMaps & Secrets

Ingress

Helm (package manager)

🎯 Goal: Deploy, scale, and manage applications in Kubernetes

6. Cloud Platforms (Pick One First)

Cloud is where DevOps lives.

Choose one cloud initially:

AWS (most popular)

Azure

GCP

Learn:

Compute (EC2 / VM)

Storage (S3)

Networking (VPC)

IAM (permissions)

Managed Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE)

🎯 Goal: Deploy production workloads in the cloud

7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Manual setup doesn’t scale.

7.1 Terraform (Must-Learn)

Learn:

Providers

Resources

Variables & modules

State management

Workspaces

🎯 Goal: Create infrastructure using code only

8. Configuration Management

Ensure servers stay consistent.

Learn one:

Ansible (most common)

Learn:

Playbooks

Roles

Inventory

Idempotency

🎯 Goal: Configure 100 servers with one command

9. Monitoring & Logging

If you can’t see it, you can’t fix it.

Monitoring

Learn:

Prometheus

Grafana

Alerts

Logging

Learn:

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Centralized logging concepts

🎯 Goal: Detect issues before users do

10. Security (DevSecOps)

Security is part of DevOps now.

Learn:

Secrets management

IAM best practices

Container security

Vulnerability scanning

HTTPS & certificates

🎯 Goal: Build secure pipelines and infrastructure

11. Advanced DevOps Skills

After core mastery:

Blue/Green & Canary deployments

Service Mesh (Istio)

Auto-scaling

Chaos Engineering

Cost optimization

12. Real-World Practice (MOST IMPORTANT)

No one becomes DevOps without practice.

Projects to Build:

CI/CD pipeline deploying Docker app to Kubernetes

Terraform to create cloud infrastructure

Monitoring setup with alerts

Zero-downtime deployment

🎯 Goal: Be able to explain why you chose each tool
