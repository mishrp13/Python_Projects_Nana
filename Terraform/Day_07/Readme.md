# Learned about Number,String, bool, List, Tuple, Set, Map, Dictionary.

# List: Here we can have multiple values of the same data-type like an array. we can access the value with their indexes.

# bool: stores true or false

# Set: Its same as list as it will also contain same data type but it will only store unique values and as it only stores unique value so we can't access it with their indexes.

# Tuple: Here we can have values of multiple data types such as float, number,bool etc but we have sure everything is arranged sequentially.

# Map: Here we can store the value in key: value format

# Dictionary(object): Collection of different element in Map(such as bool,string,number)
